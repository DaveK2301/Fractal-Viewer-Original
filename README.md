# Fractal-Viewer-Original
Fractal Viewer V1

A fractal viewer with manual color-cycling by click. New palettes can be created by the user. Can be used to save color cycling animations as folders of images (frames), and can save still images and fractal parameters. Mandlebrot and Julia sets of different fractal powers (z^2, z^3, etc.) can be drawn, with different transformations available to be applied to the color mapping. This code was produced before my recent Bachelors and Masters degrees in Computer Science at UW Tacoma, and as such does not show some of code practices learned there. Was used for personal creation of graphics and assumes the user is very familiar with fractal iteration and the Mandlebrot and Julia sets. Much of it was created on J2SE 1.3 and J2SE 1.4 .

This is purely intended as a code sample for prospective employers or partners at this time.
